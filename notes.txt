ARRAYS : 
Array is used to store multiple elements at the same place. Elements inside the array are accessed using their index number. There are two ways to create an array.
functions on array : 
1. push() -> this basically adds an element at the end of the array.
2. pop() -> this basically removes an element at the end of the array.
3. shift() -> this removes an element from the start.
4. unshift() -> this adds an element at the start.
5. indexOf() -> this tells the index of an element.
6. some() ->  checks if the condition for all elements if some follow the condition then it returns true or else false.
7. every() -> checks if the condition for all elements if all follow the condition then it returns true or else false.
8. forEach() -> this is used to perform something on the array without returning a new array but if we try it gives undefined.
9. map() -> this is used to perform some operations on the elements and return a new array without making any changes in the original array and the size remains the same.
10. reduce() -> reduces the elements in the array to a single number and it looks like this `num.reduce((acc,val) => { return acc + val;},0)` here acc is the accumulator that stores the values that is returned for each element iteration and its value is to be set here it is 0.
11. filter() -> filters the array according to the condition that is given and gives a new array that contains only those elements that were true to the condition and its size may be less than the size of the original array.


OBJECTS : 
An object in JavaScript is used to store data as key–value pairs, where each value is accessed using its corresponding property name.
Objects can be created using 2 ways :
1. let obj1 = {
    name : "Mayank",
    age : 21,
};
2. let obj2 = new Object({name:"Jin sakai"});

The elements in the objects can be accessed by 2 ways as well. one is the `obj.name` and the other is `obj["name"]`.
The elements or the key value pair can be deleted using this keyword that is `delete obj.name`.
Nested objects means there might be some elements that have more values to them to define which creates a new object in a object.
let obj = {
    name : "Mayank",
    age : 21,
    social : {
        instagram : "hahaha",
        facebook : "hehehe"
    }
}


freeze() basically freezes the object so that no changes in the object can be made like addition of properties or changes in the values `Object.freeze(obj)`.
seal() basically seals the object so that no addition of elements in the object can be made but changes in the values can be done `Object.seal(obj)`.
